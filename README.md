# EX-9 - IMPLEMENTATION OF RSA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
## AIM:
To implement the RSA(Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) encryption algorithm(Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) using program.

## ALGORITHM :
### STEP 1 :
Select two co-prime numbers as p and q.

### STEP 2 : 
Compute n as the product of p and q.

### STEP 3 : 
Compute (p-1)*(q-1) and store it in z.

### STEP 4 : 
Select a random prime number e that is less than that of z.

### STEP 5 : 
Compute the private key, d as e * mod-1(z).

### STEP 6 : 
The cipher text is computed as messagee *

### STEP 7 : 
Decryption is done as cipherdmod n.

## PROGRAM :
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int gcd(int a, int h) 
{
    int temp;
    while(1)
    {
        temp = a % h;
        if (temp == 0)
            return h;
        a = h;
        h = temp;
    }
}
int main() 
{
    printf("JAYASREE - 212223040074\n");
    int p = 3;
    int q = 7;
    int n = p * q;
    int phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1);
    int e = 2;
    while (e < phi) 
    {
        if (gcd(e, phi) == 1)
            break;
        else
            e++;
    }
    int k = 2;
    int d = (1 + (k * phi)) / e;
    int msg = 12;
    printf("Message data = %d\n", msg);
    long long c = (long long)pow(msg, e) % n;
    printf("Encrypted data = %lld\n", c);
    long long m = (long long)pow(c, d) % n;
    printf("Original Message Sent = %lld\n", m);
    return 0;
}
```
